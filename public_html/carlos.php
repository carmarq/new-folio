<p>I'm an artist at heart. My mom was artistic like her mom, and I feel like it came down the line. Their compassion, too. I've written poetry growing up with thoughts of other arts, also. I want to be better at graphic design and photography. I graduated with my degree in Sociology May, 2017, but I wanted to do more. I joined Deep Dive Coding, a ten-week web development certification program, and graduated in June of 2018. I would like to be part of something larger than I am Some of my passions include music and film. I'm a fan of hip-hop music, and independent movies. I'm here for you guys so contact me in the form below, thank you.
